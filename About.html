        About Us
    </h1>
    <p>I am Judith Moraa Nyabuto, a Biochemist by training with a strong passion for
         software development and data analytics. My background in science has 
         equipped me with a problem-solving mindset and analytical thinking, which 
         I now apply to building digital solutions and uncovering insights from
         data. Currently, I am advancing my technical skills at Power Learn Project
          (PLP), where I am focused on mastering programming, web development, 
          and data-driven decision-making tools to bridge the gap between science 
          and technology.
